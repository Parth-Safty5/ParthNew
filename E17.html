There is a good saying that, “Success is a journey and not a destination.”<br> How true it is! If we look at the life of all successful people, we realize the truthfulness of the statement.

To achieve ambition, there are many steps which are to be followed. First of all, we have to set our goal, means we have to decide what we are and what we want to be. So proper plan and execution of the plan are very important. The tragedy of life does not lie in not reaching the goal, the tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.<br> For a great success we need a lot of confidence, patience, knowledge, perseverance and hard work. We should not waste our time because time is money. Don’t compare yourself with any other person in the world.  Always remember that the word “Impossible” means, I’m possible and if destiny is accompanied with the three D’s: determination, dedication, and devotion then everything becomes possible. We should learn from our own mistakes. We should always follow in the footsteps of great, successful people. Let’s take an example of Dhirubhai Ambani.<br> He was born in a poor family, but struggled a lot to achieve his ambition and never gave up hope because he knew that there is always a room at the top. He kept the hope alive in his heart and tried his level best and as you know he was one of the richest industrialists in the world. After all, no gains, without pains.<br> There is a great saying that successful people do not do different things, they do things differently. So work hard, continuously.
