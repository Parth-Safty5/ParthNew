<h2><b>Essay 1</b></h2>
Everyone needs that one person who just gets them—the one who backs you up, listens to your rants, and can make you laugh when you’re having the worst day ever. For me, that person is Vivaan. We’ve been inseparable since the first grade, and honestly, I can’t imagine my life without him.<br><br>
Our friendship began on my very first day of school. My family had just moved to Baroda, and I was the "new kid"—nervous, shy, and sitting all by myself at lunch. That’s when Vivaan walked up with a massive grin and asked if I wanted to play paper football. It was such a small gesture, but it changed everything. As it turned out, fate was on our side; we discovered we lived in the same neighborhood, with our buildings right next to each other.<br><br>
What I admire most about Vivaan is his genuine kindness. He’s the type of person who goes out of his way to include everyone, making sure nobody feels left out during a game. He’s also the funniest person I know. We share this specific brand of humor where we’ll start laughing until our stomachs ache, often over something nobody else finds funny.<br><br>
He’s also incredibly patient. I usually struggle with Math, but Vivaan—who is a natural at it—never makes me feel slow. He’ll sit with me and explain a problem three different ways until it finally clicks. We have this unspoken pact: we study together, share our notes, and always have each other's backs when one of us forgets a textbook.

<h2><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Parth<span style='color:#FFC000'>New</span><o:p></o:p></span></b></h2><br>

When we aren't studying, you can usually find us on our bikes. We treat our neighborhood like an uncharted map, coming up with ridiculous names for the streets and "exploring" like we’re on a mission. We’re also both obsessed with superhero movies and collecting football cards. Even though Vivaan has a much better collection than I do, he never hesitates to share.<br><br>
Of course, we aren't perfect. We’ve had our fair share of blowouts, like the time we both fought over being the team captain at school. We didn't speak for a bit, but we eventually realized that a silly title wasn't worth losing a best friend over. That’s the best part about Vivaan—he doesn’t hold grudges. We talk it out, laugh it off, and move on.<br><br>
Having Vivaan in my corner makes the hard parts of life—whether it's school stress or family stuff—much easier to handle. He’s more than just a best friend; he’s the brother I chose. We’ve already promised that no matter where we go for college or where our lives take us, we’ll always stay in touch.<br><br>
I feel incredibly lucky to have found a friend like him so early in life. He makes every day a bit brighter, and I hope everyone gets to experience a friendship like ours.


<h2><b>Essay 2</b></h2>
A best friend is more than just a companion; they are the person who makes life feel lighter and much more meaningful. I’m lucky enough to share a bond built on genuine love, trust, and understanding. Whether we are facing challenges or celebrating wins, we grow together and make every moment count.<br><br>
My best friend’s presence turns an ordinary day into something special. In this essay, I want to share the story of how Mayank and I became inseparable and why our friendship means the world to me.<br><br>
I still remember my first day of school—I was a nervous wreck. Everything felt huge and unfamiliar. To make matters worse, I realized I had left my pencil box at home and started to panic.<br><br>
Mayank, who was sitting right next to me, noticed I was struggling before I even said a word. Without hesitation, he offered me one of his pens with a kind smile. That small act of generosity immediately calmed my nerves. We started talking, and by the end of the day, my anxiety had vanished. From that moment on, we were a team.<br><br>
Mayank is incredibly bright—definitely one of the top students in our class. Even though I’m not quite as studious as he is, he never makes me feel inferior or shows off his grades. Instead, he uses his strengths to lift me up, always encouraging me to keep trying.

What I admire most about him is his humility and honesty. He is the one person I can trust with my deepest worries and my biggest joys. He has this amazing ability to stay calm when things go wrong, and his positive energy is contagious. Just being around him makes me want to be a better person.<br><br>
We spend most of our time together, whether we’re side-by-side in class or hanging out after school. We help each other through tough lessons, swap lunch stories, and always team up for debates and quizzes—we’ve actually won a few prizes together!<br><br>
Since we both love reading, we’re constantly exchanging books. Our friendship also extends to our families; I visit his home during festivals, and he joins mine. Sharing those celebrations makes the holidays feel much more vibrant.<br><br>
Mayank is so much more than a classmate. He understands me in a way few people do. If I’m having a bad day, he doesn’t just offer a quick fix; he listens patiently and knows exactly what to say to boost my spirits.<br><br>
I’ll never forget the time I caught a high fever and missed a week of school. Mayank didn't just tell me what I missed—he brought over his notes and spent time explaining the lessons so I wouldn't fall behind for exams. It’s that kind of empathy and loyalty that makes our bond so precious.<br><br>
They say a true friend is a gift, and I truly believe that. Mayank has been my steady companion through the highs and the lows. Our friendship is built on a foundation of mutual respect and love, and I honestly hope it lasts a lifetime. I wish everyone could have a friend like Mayank to add that extra bit of joy and meaning to their life.<br><br>

<h2><b>Essay 3</b></h2>
Friends are the heartbeat of our lives. They are the ones who celebrate our wins, sit with us through our losses, and somehow make the long journey of life feel like a fun adventure. For me, a best friend isn't just someone to hang out with; it’s someone who truly "gets" me and accepts me exactly as I am. That person is Mitesh, and we’ve been inseparable since we were kids.<br><br>
Mitesh has this naturally kind and cheerful energy that draws people in. He’s the type of person who goes out of his way to help others without ever looking for a "thank you" or anything in return.<br><br>
When it comes to school, he’s incredibly focused. On days when I feel burnt out or ready to give up, he’s always there to give me that extra push to keep going. What I value most about him, though, is his honesty and loyalty. He never judges people; instead, he’s always the first person to offer a shoulder to lean on when things get tough.<br><br>
We have so much in common that it’s hard to get bored when we’re together. Whether we’re lost in a good book, playing a heated game of cricket, or heading out to explore a new part of town, we always have a great time.

<h2><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Parth<span style='color:#FFC000'>New</span><o:p></o:p></span></b></h2><br>

But our friendship goes deeper than just shared hobbies. Whenever I’m facing a problem, Mitesh is my go-to person. He’s a great listener and always offers the kind of sensible, grounded advice I need to hear. Our bond is built on a foundation of mutual trust and respect, and honestly, it just feels like it gets stronger every single day.<br><br>
I feel incredibly lucky to have someone like Mitesh standing by me through thick and thin. He isn’t just a friend or a classmate; he’s more like a brother to me. He adds a layer of meaning and joy to my life that I can’t really put into words.<br><br>
A true best friend is someone who makes your world a better place just by being in it. I hope that whatever the future holds, our friendship continues to grow, and we stay this close forever.<br><br>
