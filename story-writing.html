                <p>Once there was a poor boy named Rahul who lived in a small village. His father was a daily wage laborer, and his mother worked in the fields. Despite their poverty, Rahul had a big dream: he wanted to become a scientist. He used to study under the dim light of a street lamp because his house didn't have electricity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One day, his school announced a district-level science exhibition. Rahul wanted to participate, but he had no money for the materials. Instead of giving up, he collected waste items like plastic bottles, old wires, and cardboard. He spent nights working on a model that showed how to generate electricity using wind power.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When the day of the exhibition arrived, many students from rich schools came with expensive models. However, Rahul’s working model of a windmill made from trash caught everyone's eye. The judges were amazed by his creativity and dedication. Rahul won the first prize and a scholarship for his higher studies. His hard work had finally paved the way for a bright future.</p>

                <h2 class="story-title">A Hero in the Crowd</h2>
                <p>It was a typical busy evening at the Pune railway station. People were rushing to catch their trains, and the platform was crowded with passengers and luggage. Rohit, a young college student, was waiting for his friend when he noticed an elderly man trying to cross the yellow line as a train was fast approaching.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The old man seemed confused and stumbled near the edge of the platform. The train whistled loudly, and the ground began to vibrate. Everyone else stood frozen in shock, but Rohit didn't waste a single second. He sprinted towards the man and pulled him back with all his strength just as the engine roared past the spot.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The elderly man was trembling with fear but was safe. A crowd gathered around them, and the station master arrived at the scene. They realized that Rohit's quick reflex had saved a life from a certain accident. The old man thanked Rohit with tears in his eyes, and everyone praised Rohit for his timely help.</p>
