                    <div style="margin-bottom:8px;">      ‘The Three Mistakes of My Life’ is a novel written by Chetan Bhagat who writes about Indians and for Indians. His characters are young and passionate. The novel follows the story of three friends and is based in the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat.</div>
                    <div style="margin-bottom:8px;">         Govind Jaat Patel is an ordinary guy with whom anybody can relate. Being a Gujarati his ambition is to become a businessman. His friend is Omi who is the son of a Hindu priest of the local temple. He is confused about his religious views which are mainly influenced by Bitoo Mama. Ishan is a big cricket freak and a patriot.</div>
                    <div style="margin-bottom:8px;">He was the best cricketer in his locality and school. He helps Govind’s business by organizing daily cricket coaching camps. He has a younger sister Vidya who is weak in Mathematics. Ishan asks Govind to take her Mathematics tuition. In between their tuition, they fall in love which is kept secret.</div>
                    <div style="margin-bottom:8px;">        The whole story revolves around Govind and his friends and the three mistakes he made. It is pop- fiction of lightest, laziest sort, which tackles serious real-life issues and incidents giving it a veneer of earnest thoughtfulness that stands up to nothing. It is written simply and has the quality that makes one want to read the book in one sitting. The target audience of the book is the young generation. It is based on fun, emotion and pace to turn it into a potential best-seller.</div>
